**Parker Simulation Chapter**      

Introduction to simulations: 

Simulations will allow: 
-	Statistical inference to complex models 
-	Estimate quantities that can’t be carried out analytically 
-	Make predictions from certain scenarios (such as the outcome of an event) 

Covered in **Parker Simulation Chapter**      
-	Simulating a sample from common probability distributions (creating data that will occur in a certain way from different types of distribution) 
-	Simulation experiments for sampling distributions (using statistical methods to make predictions) 
-	Simulation experiments for type I error rates and power calculations (can test the performance of a statistical test) 

Simulating from non-standard distributions (Accept-Reject and MCMC): these do not have straightforward mathematical formulas for generating random values.

Accept-Reject method: 
-	Will generate random samples from a difficult to sample distribution (instead uses a simpler distribution)
-	This simpler distribution will surround the target distribution 
-	Random samples are drawn from the simpler distribution, samples are accepted or rejected based on a certain criteria 
-	Accepted samples used as samples from the target distribution 

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
-	Broad class of techniques: includes several algorithms used to generate samples from complex distributions 
-	Constructs a Markov chain (a sequence of states) – distribution of states converges to the desired target distribution 
-	Powerful method for simulating from distributions that are challenging to the sample directly

Simulation experiment from a SIR epidemic model 
-	This part of the chapter will show one how to use simulations to study and analyse the dynamics of an infectious disease 
-	This is done using an SIR model (susceptible infectious recovered) epidemic model 
-	The SIR model is a basic compartmental model in epidemiology – describes the the spread of infectious diseases within a population
