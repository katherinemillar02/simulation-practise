if function 
- take a certain action based on the outcome of an event
- looking at conditional statements
- logical data in binary 

if statement 
- program unit is a conditional statement 
- selection of action from multiple possibilities 
- use different lines 
- Conditional statements usually reside inside a function. 
-express alternative behavior depending on argument values.
- a conditional statement begins with an if header
- What appears after the keyword is a pair of parentheses, in which a condition to examine appears. - After the condition part appears an action to perform, which is a series of statements flanked by a pair of curly braces.

- The syntax specifies that if the condition inside the pair of parentheses is true,
- the program executes the statements appearing in the ensuing pair of braces.
- We call a statement in this form an if statement.
- Let us see our first example of an if statement, which is a function that returns the sign of a number.

- If a conditional statement contains a return statement and R executes that statement, R skips the remainder of the code in the function.



- Instead of saying “if x is less than 0, it is negative”, 
- it would be more natural to say 
- “otherwise, if x is less than 0, it is negative”.
- We can express “otherwise” using the keyword else. Let’s revise the above code

 
 General description of if statement 
 if (<expression>) {
    <body>
} else if (<expression>) {
    <body>
} else if (<expression>) {
    <body>
...
} else {
    <body>
}

else means otherwise 
else and if = else if 
 We can stack up else if blocks after an initial if to define a series of alternative options.
 
 

- An if-block cannot begin with an else in the series.
- There must exist one if clause.
- When a series of else if blocks appear after an if, this represents a series of alternatives.
- We   call this an if sequence.
- An if without a preceding else begins a new if sequence.
- R scans all the conditions appearing in an if sequence takes an action when it finds a condition that evaluates to TRUE. All other actions before and after the matching one are ignored.
- The else block is optional; it takes care of everything that does not have a match.

Parker Simulation Chapter 
- simulating a sample from common probability distributions
- simulation experiments for sampling distributions
 - simulation experiments for type I error rates and power calculations.
- For those interested in more complex applications of simulation, we will also provide (though not cover in class)

- simulating from non-standard distributions (Accept-Reject and MCMC)
- simulation experiment from a SIR epidemic model.

- Sometimes you want to generate data from a distribution (such as normal),
- or want to see where a value falls in a known distribution. R has these distributions built in:

-Normal
-Binomial
-Beta
-Exponential
-Gamma
-Hypergeometric
-.........and many more in both base R and other add on packages.

- Each family of functions for a distribution has 4 options:

- r for random number generation [e.g. rnorm()]
- d for density [e.g. dnorm()]
- p for probability [e.g. pnorm()]
 - q for quantile [e.g. qnorm()]
 - For example, we can simulate a random sample of size 5 from a standard normal distribution by using rnorm.
 
 
 - To find the probability of being less than 5 in a Normal distribution with mean 4 and standard deviation 2, we would use pnorm.
 - the code they show is wrong?
