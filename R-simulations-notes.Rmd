if function 
- take a certain action based on the outcome of an event
- looking at conditional statements
- logical data in binary 

if statement 
- program unit is a conditional statement 
- selection of action from multiple possibilities 
- use different lines 
- Conditional statements usually reside inside a function. 
-express alternative behavior depending on argument values.
- a conditional statement begins with an if header
- What appears after the keyword is a pair of parentheses, in which a condition to examine appears. - After the condition part appears an action to perform, which is a series of statements flanked by a pair of curly braces.

- The syntax specifies that if the condition inside the pair of parentheses is true,
- the program executes the statements appearing in the ensuing pair of braces.
- We call a statement in this form an if statement.
- Let us see our first example of an if statement, which is a function that returns the sign of a number.

- If a conditional statement contains a return statement and R executes that statement, R skips the remainder of the code in the function.



- Instead of saying “if x is less than 0, it is negative”, 
- it would be more natural to say 
- “otherwise, if x is less than 0, it is negative”.
- We can express “otherwise” using the keyword else. Let’s revise the above code
