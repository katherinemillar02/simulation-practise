# Simulations in R üïπ

This is my GitHub repository for learning and going through certain simulation chapters throughout R workbooks and sites found online and on GitHub. 

## Scripts üìù

This includes links to the relevant workbooks and resources and my scripted solutions for task completion.

Link to Workbook: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/simulation.html      
Released: 31/05/20222 - Roger D. Peng         
Workbook: "R Programming for Data Science"           
In this script, I have covered the Simulation Chapter (Chapter 20) from the workbook "R Programming for Data Science" by Roger D. Peng. The chapter delves into the following topics:  
- Random Number Generator
- Setting the seed: controls randomness or repeatability
- Simulating a linear model: simulating values from a specific model
- Random Sampling: taking from specified objects

Workbook: "Lab 3: Simulations in R"       
This covers:     
- General random number generating
- apply() function (Avoiding for loops)
- Generating random 'normal' variables and mixing normal data

- Generating Multivariate normal clusters
- Monte Carlo Simulations
- Gamma distribution sampling, generating poisson distribution 
- Generating information of power of statistical tests
