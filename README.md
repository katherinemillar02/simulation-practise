# Simulations in R 🕹

This is my GitHub repository for learning and going through certain simulation chapters throughout R workbooks and sites found online and on GitHub. 

## Scripts 📝

This includes links to the relevant workbooks and resources and my scripted solutions for task completion. 

### 1. peng_simulation_chapter.R  ✅   
Link to Workbook: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/simulation.html      
Released: 31/05/20222 - Roger D. Peng         
Workbook: "R Programming for Data Science"           
In this script, I have covered the Simulation Chapter (Chapter 20) from the workbook "R Programming for Data Science" by Roger D. Peng. The chapter delves into the following topics:  
- Random Number Generator
- Setting the seed: controls randomness or repeatability
- Simulating a linear model: simulating values from a specific model
- Random Sampling: taking from specified objects 

### 2. stanford_simulation_chapter.R ✅     
This is a script for my progress through a workbook on Simulations in R, by Stanford University 🏛️.

📅Released: 11/05/2023 (Last Updated) - Stanford University       
📚Workbook: "Lab 3: Simulations in R"       
This covers:     
- General random number generation
- Utilising the **apply()** function (avoiding for loops and enhancing efficieny)
- Generating and manipulating random 'normal' variables 
- Experimenting with DNA string genration (old 'out of date' package used)
- Generating Multivariate normal clusters
- Exploring Monte Carlo Simulations
- Sampling from Gamma distribution and generating Poisson distribution 
- Generating information of power of statistical tests

Workbook: "Introduction to R, lecture Notes"     
Simulation Chapter (Chapter 13) covers:     
- Standard probability distributions (normal, binomial, beta, exponential, gamma, hypergeometric)
- Sampling from complex distributions (accept-reject, student's t-test)
- Doing simulations from studies and experiments (including from models)
